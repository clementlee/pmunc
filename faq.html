						<p>For PMUNC 2014, delegate fees will be $85 per student. This includes all Conference fees and transportation to and from Princeton University for campus visits on Friday Morning. The delegation fee is $50 per school; however, the delegation fee will be waived for all schools that register during the Early Registration period. Transportation to and from the Conference is the responsibility of each delegation. Other costs for the Conference include hotel rooms and meals.

						<p>Early registration runs until September 10th. Schools that register before that and will have their school fee waived and receive preference in Committee &amp; Country Assignments!

						<p>PMUNC 2014 offers you the possibility of registering online, making your life much easier! We have an updated website this year with a new aesthetic as well as a new and improved registration system. You can be registered immediately for the Conference and not have to wait for that check to be cut to start receiving information.It also helps us expedite the registration process immensely. Please remember, however, that for hotel and committee/country assignments you will only be considered fully registered after we have received your full payment.</p>

										</li>
										<li>This year, PMUNC is proud to introduce a new online payment system, through which delegations can pay by using a credit card. On the system, you will be able to pay for both conference registration fees (delegation and delegate), as well as meal plans but not hotel fees. The link to the conference payment system will be sent to you via email from the Charg&eacute; d'Affaires.										</li>

								<p>Countries will not be assigned if we have not received registration payment. Schools that register by the Early Registration date will have priority in Country &amp; Committee Assignments.

						<div id="qf" class="collapse">
							<p>Some of our committees are very narrowly focused; application committees will likely be faster paced and will require a higher level of commitment on the delegates’ part. By requiring an application, we hope to ensure that the delegates in the committee are interested, engaged and willing to put the time and effort into their positions. However, please do not be intimidated or discouraged by the application in any way. The main criteria for selection are your interests and the degree to which we believe the committee will help you develop as a delegate.
